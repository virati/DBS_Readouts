## Re-Referencing

## Limitations

### PvA vs AvP
* Compare
* Intro/Def **Coverage**

### Fixed $\Gamma$ and $H$

* Uniform $\Gamma$
* Power-Law $\Gamma$

Calculate reasonable bounds on performance

### Designing $H$
* SSPOC

## Classifiers and IRR

### IRR in Degeneracy
* Middle Layer Disagreements can map to High IRR in DM

## Next-Steps
* Takens for supra-theoretical performance
