# Framework for DBS Readouts Project

A set of tools for theoretical analysis and design of DBS readouts.

## Basic Model
- [ ] System and RO System
- [ ] Assessment from Accuracy of $\Theta \y \approx \beta$ and Alignment of $\Theta$ to $\Gamma$.
## Re-Referencing

- [ ] $\partial$ LFP
- [ ]  Laplacians

### PvA vs AvP
- [ ] Compare and Coverage
- [ ] "How Much" vs "Whether" for the $R^2$.
  
### Fixed $\Gamma$ and $H$

- [X] Random $\Gamma$
- [ ] Uniform $\Gamma$
- [ ] Power-Law $\Gamma$

Calculate reasonable bounds on performance - with a focus on the ceiling.

### Assess impact of Noise
- [ ] Measurement Noise
- [ ] Behavior Noise

## Future Work

### Designing $H$
* SSPOC

## Classifiers and IRR

### IRR in Degeneracy
* Middle Layer Disagreements can map to High IRR in DM

## Next-Steps
* Takens for supra-theoretical performance
